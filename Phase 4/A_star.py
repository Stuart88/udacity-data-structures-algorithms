'''

This is an implementation of the A* algorithm for path finding, using a given map
with road and intersection information available to work with.

For efficient and minimal path finding operation, the heuristic value 'h' for each point
is calculated as the pythagorean distance between that point and the goal.

NOTE:
	Typical heuristic distances include:
		
		Manhattan distance: 
			Best used on a grid where movements are limited to 4 directions up/down/left/right directions
			The available paths are straight or 'L' shaped
		
		Diagonal distance:
			Best used on a grid where movements are limited to 8 directions
			up / down / left / right / up-left / up-right / down-left / down-right
		
		Euclidean distance:
			The straight line distance between two points
			Best applied where any direction can be followed
			For the case of this assignment, the Euclidian distance has been chosen as a heuristic,
			because the path between points can take any direction


During path traversal, the value 'g' is the current most efficient 
distance from the start point to the point currently being looked at.

Finally, each visited point is assigned a total value 'f' (= g + h) which represents the current
best estimate for the a complete path that goes via that point.

The aim is to efficiently find the path with the best 'f' value that starts at the start node
and traverses the map to the end node, using the heuristic 'h' to guide the algorithm
in the correct direction, so as to prevent the need to manually check every point 
on the map.

Complexity:

	Complexity depends highly on the arrangement of the given map, i.e. number
	of roads and intersections and how they are laid out.

	Generally, some research tells me the following:
	
	Time: O(b^d) 
		where b is the 'branching factor' - the average number of roads from each point,
		and d is the depth of the resulting path.
	
	Space: O(d)  - The algorithm only stores useful path node data

	Worst caseï¼š
		Time: O(n^n) for map with all nodes interconnected
		Space: O(n) as all nodes will be stored in the 'visited' set of nodes
