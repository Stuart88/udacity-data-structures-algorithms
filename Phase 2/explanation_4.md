Uses recursion to check sub groups.

Reasoning: Cleaner than iterating through all items using sub-loops.

Time efficiency: 

    O(n), where n is the total number of users across all groups

Space efficiency:

    Does not use any extra memory beyond that which is needed to 
    create the group objects at the start
